                        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What services do you provide?</p>
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> We specialize in helping college students move out of their dorms at the end of the year. We pick up your belongings from your dorm (specified in the moving form) and deliver them to an address you provide later. The process is seamless and stress-free.</p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You fill out a moving form on our website, providing the dorm location, delivery address, and the number of boxes you need. You'll also select a 4-hour time slot for both pickup and delivery.</p>
